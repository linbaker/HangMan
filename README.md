## Description

_Structure and files to build an Epicodus C# Week 2 Project:_

* _A main directory called MVCWebAppTemplate, including a .gitignore file and README. You can rename this directory from the Desktop or Terminal, but not in Atom._
* _A ProjectName subdirectory, including Startup.cs, Program.cs and ProjectName.csproj_
* _A Controllers subdirectory, including HomeControllers.cs_
* _A Models subdirectory, including ProjectVariable.cs_
* _A Views/Home subdirectory, including Input.cshtml and Output.cshtml (names match in HomeControllers.cs)_
* _A wwwroot/css subdirectory, including styles.css_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone from GitHub_
* _(Optional) $mv MVCWebAppTemplate DirectoryNameOfYourChoice_
* _$cd MVCWebAppTemplate (or new name if renamed)_
* _$rm -rf .git to delete my commit history_
* _$git init to create a new git repository_
* _$atom . to open all the files in Atom_
* _(Optional) $atom . and rename each file to your current project name (see note below)_
* _(Optional) Rename namespaces and class names in the .cs files_
* _$cd ProjectName (or new name if renamed)_
* _$dotnet restore to install packages from the .csproj file_
* _$dotnet run to run the application_

_And you're done! You can commit this to a repository of your choice as your initial commit._

_Note: If you don't rename the files before $dotnet restore / $dotnet build, all the files created will use ProjectName. Renaming after $dotnet restore / $dotnet build is a tedious and error-prone task._
